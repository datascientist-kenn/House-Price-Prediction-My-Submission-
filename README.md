# House-Price-Prediction-My-Submission-
This repository contains my code, conclusion and prediction of the House Prediction Challenge.
On this analysis, it was required to predict the prices of different houses given certain data about them. The variable in view here is the ‘SalePrice’.
It was necessary to see how other variables in the dataset relate and correlate with SalePrice so an extensive exploratory data analysis was necessary.
